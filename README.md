# [Create JavaScript Project](https://create-project.js.org/)
Set up a JavaScript project by running one command.

Before you start, you need to globally install `create-js-project` via npm or yarn:

```sh
npm i -g create-js-project

yarn global add create-js-project
```

Then, follow these 3 simple steps:

1. Create a project, optionally providing a [project-name] for your project:
```
create-js-project [project-name]

npm init js-project [project-name]
```
2. Answer the questions, such as your project's name and desired template.
3. Wait until the installation is complete and start coding!
